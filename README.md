My First Machine Learning Model

This project is my first hands-on implementation of a **Linear Regression model** using **Scikit-Learn**.  
It was completed as part of my Coursera lab on predicting **house prices**.

---

## 📌 Objective
Build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict **house prices** based on features such as:
- Square footage of living area (`sqft_living`)
- Number of bedrooms (`bedrooms`)
- Number of bathrooms (`bathrooms`)
- Number of floors (`floors`)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Steps
1. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, selecting features)
2. Train-test split (80/20)
3. Build **Linear Regression model**
4. Evaluate performance using:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared (R²)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Residual analysis

---

## ✅ Results
- **MSE**: ~74,224,655,277  
- **R²**: ~0.292  
- **MAE**: ~181,510  
- Residual mean ~ -10,095  
- Residual std ~ 272,419

## 🚀 Future Work
- Try Decision Tree and Random Forest models for comparison
- Improve feature engineering to increase accuracy
- Hyperparameter tuning
